				<h1>Our privacy notice</h1>
<p>Welcome to the 1FX privacy notice.</p>
<p>1FX  respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal data. This privacy notice will inform you as to how we look after your personal data when you visit our website (regardless of where you visit it from) and tell you about your privacy rights and how the law protects you.</p>
<p>Please also use the Glossary at the bottom of this Privacy Notice to understand the meaning of some of the terms used in this privacy notice.</p>

<h2>Important information and who we are</h2>
<h2>Purpose of this privacy notice</h2>
<p>This privacy notice aims to give you information on how 1FX collects and processes your personal data through your use of this website, including any data you may provide through this website when you sign up to receive information or updates about our business.</p>
<p>This website is not intended for children and we do not knowingly collect data relating to children.</p>
<p>It is important that you read this privacy notice together with any other privacy notice or fair processing notice we may provide on specific occasions when we are collecting or processing personal data about you so that you are fully aware of how and why we are using your data.</p>
<p>This privacy notice supplements the other notices and is not intended to override them.</p>

<h2>Controller</h2>
<p>1FX  is the controller and responsible for your personal data (referred to as, "we", "us", or "our" in this privacy notice). If you have any questions about this privacy notice, including any requests to exercise your legal rights please contact us using the details set out below.</p>

<h2>Contact details</h2>
<p>Our full details are:</p>
<p>Full name of legal entity: 1FX</p>
<p>Email address: traderzx11@gmail.com</p>
<p>Postal address:</p>
<p>You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues (www.ico.org.uk). We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO so please contact us in the first instance.</p>

<h2>Changes to the privacy notice and your duty to inform us of changes</h2>
<p>The data protection law in the UK will change on 25 May 2018. Although this privacy notice sets out most of your rights under the new laws, we may not yet be able to respond to some of your requests (for example, a request for the transfer of your personal data) until May 2018 as we are still working towards getting our systems ready for some of these changes.</p>
<p>It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal data changes during your relationship with us.</p>

<h2>Third-party links</h2>
<p>This website may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins, and applications. Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or share data about you. We do not control these third-party websites and are not responsible for their privacy statements. When you leave our website, we encourage you to read the privacy notice of every website you visit.</p>

<h2>The data we collect about you</h2>
<p>Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data). We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about you which we have grouped together as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Identity Data includes first name, last name, username, or similar identifier.</li>
	<li>Contact Data includes email addresses and telephone numbers.</li>
	<li>Technical Data includes internet protocol (IP) address, your login data, browser type, and version, time zone setting and location, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform, and other technology on the devices you use to access this website.</li>
	<li>Marketing and Communications Data includes your preferences in receiving marketing from us and our third parties and your communication preferences.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also collect, use, and share Aggregated Data such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated Data may be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity.</p>
<p>For example, we may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific website feature. However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this privacy notice.</p>
<p>We do not collect any Special Categories of Personal Data about you (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health, and genetic and biometric data). Nor do we collect any information about criminal convictions and offenses.</p>

<h2>If you fail to provide personal data</h2>
<p>You are not obliged to provide us with personal data by law, or under the terms of any contract. The provision of personal data by you is entirely voluntary and at your discretion. If however, you decide not to provide us personal data that will mean that we are unable to provide you with details of our business.</p>

<h2>How is your personal data collected?</h2>
<p>We use different methods to collect data from and about you including through:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Direct interactions. You may give us your Identity, and Contact Data by filling in forms or by corresponding with us by post, phone, email, or otherwise. This includes personal data you provide when you:</li>
	<li>fill out a form or create an account on our website;</li>
	<li>request marketing to be sent to you; or</li>
	<li>give us some feedback.</li>
	<li>Automated technologies or interactions. As you interact with our website, we may automatically collect Technical Data about your equipment, browsing actions, and patterns. We collect this personal data by using cookies, server logs, and other similar technologies. Please see our cookie policy for further details.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How we use your personal data</h2>
<p>We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.</li>
	<li>Where you have given us your consent to do so.</li>
	<li>Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Where we rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data (for example in order to send direct marketing communications to you via email) you have the right to withdraw consent to marketing at any time by contacting us at traderzx11@gmail.com.</p>

<h2>Purposes for which we will use your personal data</h2>
<p>We have set out below, in a table format, a description of all the ways we plan to use your personal data, and which of the legal bases we rely on to do so. We have also identified what our legitimate interests are where appropriate.</p>
<p>Note that we may process your personal data for more than one lawful ground depending on the specific purpose for which we are using your data. Please contact us at traderzx11@gmail.com if you need details about the specific legal ground we are relying on to process your personal data where more than one ground has been set out in the table below.</p>
<img src="images/table.html" class="" align="">

<h2>Marketing</h2>
<p>We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising and we will not send you any marketing emails or allow your data to be used to send marketing emails or other communications unless you have expressly consented (opted-in) to that.</p>

<h2>Opting out</h2>
<p>You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by following the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you or by contacting us at any time.</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this website may become inaccessible or not function properly. For more information about the cookies we use, please see our cookie policy</p>

<h2>Change of purpose</h2>
<p>We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us at traderzx11@gmail.com.</p>
<p>If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.</p>
<p>Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.</p>

<h2>Disclosures of your personal data</h2>
<p>We may have to share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table in paragraph 4 above.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Internal Third Parties as set out in the Glossary.</li>
	<li>External Third Parties as set out in the Glossary.</li>
	<li>Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy notice.</li>
</ul>
<p>We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</p>

<h2>International transfers</h2>
<p>Many of our external third parties are based outside the European Economic Area (EEA) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.</p>
<p>Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p>
<ul>
	<li>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission. For further details, see European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in nonEU countries.</li>
	<li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries.</li>
	<li>Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US. For further details, see European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.</p>

<h2>Data security</h2>
<p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used, or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered, or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors, and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p>
<p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>

<h2>Data retention</h2>
<h3>How long will you use my personal data? </h3>
<p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>
<p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data, and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>

<h2>Your legal rights</h2>
<p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. These rights include the right to:</p>
<p>Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
</p>
<p>Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p>
<p>Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us to continue to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p>
<p>Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>
<p>Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:</p>
<ul>
	<li>if you want us to establish the data's accuracy;</li>
	<li>where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it;</li>
	<li>where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims; or</li>
	<li>you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information that you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p>
<p>Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.</p>
<p>If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p>
<p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us.</p>

<h2>No fee usually required</h2>
<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>

<h2>What we may need from you</h2>
<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>

<h2>Time limit to respond</h2>
<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>

<h2>Glossary</h2>
<h2>LAWFUL BASIS</h2>
<p>Legitimate Interest means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us</p>
<p>Comply with a legal or regulatory obligation means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal or regulatory obligation that we are subject to.</p>
